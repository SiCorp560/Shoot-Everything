Shoot Everything

“In the deep void of space, a lone fighter rocket is all that stands between Earth and invading enemy forces. Do you have what it takes to survive and destroy them all? It doesn’t take much thought – just Shoot Everything!”
 
Shoot Everything is a Galaga-inspired shoot-’em-up game with increasing difficulty in its enemy generation, the inclusion of Boids' algorithm in certain enemy movements, and line collision to dictate object interactions.

In order to play the game, simply run the GameModes.py file. The PIL module is first required for cmu_112_graphics.py to work properly. Instructions on how to download it can be found here: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~112/notes/notes-animations-part3.html

Several debug commands are present in the game's code, specifically within the GameModes.py file. They are currently inactive at the moment, but in order to unlock them, all that needs to be done is to remove the triple ''' around the entire set of code. In order, here are the debug features;

Press "1": spawns a Faller enemy
Press "2": spawns a Runner enemy
Press "3": spawns a Swarm enemy
Press "4": spawns a Host enemy
Press "5": spawns a Bully enemy
